Algorithms
=========================

This repository is used to show some generic implementations of various algorithms using C#.

Feel free to contribute anytime, but please note that this repository sets a high value on well implemented algorithms, so every
algorithm has to include unit tests. Ideally those unit tests should be written in NUnit.
To ensure that the algorithms are as versatile as possible, they must be generic.
We do not guarantee that the algorithms are free of mistakes, but we put great strength in avoiding them.

## Build
To build this project, simply execute the build.sh.
This project includes F# FAKE, a great project for building your applications.
A .bat file for Windows will follow soon.
